% CARS subroutine using Mukamel equations
% 
% ----------------------------------------------------------
% This routine performs a homogeneously broadened CARS 1d-integral using
% time-domain equations.  They use equations 5.13 and 6.16b in first edition of his book.
% This routine is meant to be used for one sample's secondary CARS feature.
%
% Units:
% time=picoseconds
% frequency=wavenumbers
%
% Variables:
%  
% the vector 'params' contains the following parameters, in this order:
%
% (parameters with an 'X' in front are unused in this subroutine)
%
% 	T2  	=	time between w3 and w2 (t3-t2) based on delay positions
% 	T1		=	time between w2 and w1 (t2-t1) based on delay positions
% 	sigma1		= temporal FWHM (in psec) of the laser pulse 1, using the form 
%				     E=-t^2/(2*sigma1)^2
%	sigma2 = " "		"	pulse 2
% 	sigma3 = " "    "  pulse 3
%X A1, A2, A3, Acars, Acarsref, Bg = scaling factors for each FWM process in the order:
%				DOVE-IR1, DOVE-IR2, DOVE-Raman, CARS, CARS of reference, background
%				
%X Gcg,Gcb,Gbg,Gag	= Homogeneous linewidths (HWHM) for the coherences set up by pulses 1,2,and 3,
%				
%X wcg,wbg,wag =  The ringing frequencies of the respective coherences set up by pulses 1,2, and 3.
% 			
% Ttot = estimated time at which the output coherence will have approximately decayed to zero
% del= 'dt' -- that is, the step size for the integral (smaller is better, but longer to compute)
%
%X wagref = frequency of CARS reference position in Raman space.
%X Gagref = homogeneous linewidth (HWHM) of CARS reference. 
%X theta21 = phasematching angle of w2 with respect to w1.
%X theta31 = phasematching angle of w3 with respect to w1.  Positive value means on the opposite
% 				side of w1 with respect to w2.
%X ls = thickness of sample (cm)
%X lfw= thickness of front window (cm)
%X	wagalt = frequency of alternate CARS feature
% Gagalt = homogeneous linewidth (HWHM) of alternate CARS feature 
%X Acarsalt= scaling factor of alternate CARS feature
%X Asive = SIVE scaling factor for sample's main absorbing feature
%X Imbg = imaginary background additional term (should be zero)
%
% t = see Mukamel equations
%
% These subroutines use a ZERO-order half-transform routine.  Therefore, the subroutines are
%	prone to large errors when examining w1-w2 frequencies far removed from resonance.  See "Numerical
%  Recipes in Fortran" or other Numerical methods texts for better-orders results if needed.
%
% NOTE:  iffts are used for positive resonances (wcg,wcb,wag), and must be multiplied by
%			N*dt, where N is the total	number of points in the final ifft.  Negative resonances 
%  		(wgb) use fft for this code, and are only multiplied by dt, due to Matlab's
%			syntax of the fft/ifft functions.
%
%			Also, note that each fft has to be multiplied by i/hbar.
